    <h1>Gondor</h1>
    <p><a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gondor">Gondor</a> was the most prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath, moved to Minas Anor in TA 1640. This city, later renamed Minas Tirith, remained the capital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into the Fourth Age; other major fortresses included Pelargir, Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Minas Ithil.

	Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from Númenor. Gondor was the sister kingdom of Arnor, whose line of kings came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor descended from Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded, and the former lands of Arnor were united with it under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.

	In all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was slain in the War of the Last Alliance at the Siege of Barad-dûr.</p>
    <h1>Rohan</h1>
    <p>Rohan, or the Riddermark (<a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Rohirric">Rohirric</a>), was a great kingdom of Men located in the land once known as Calenardhon, situated in the great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains. The land of Rohan extended from the banks of the river Isen in the west, up to the East wall of Rohan and shores of the river Anduin in the east. The forest of Fangorn lay on its border, and the Elven forest of Lothlórien lay north of the river Limlight.

	The land of Rohan was originally part of Gondor, but gained independence from it. The land was first known as "Rohan" to the Men of Gondor, and its people the Rohirrim, meaning 'the Horse-lords', but the people of Rohan called themselves the Eorlingas, sons of Eorl the Young, first King of Rohan, as the land of Calenardhon was given in gift to Eorl and his people by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, in thanks for their service to Gondor in battle against the Balchoth. Eorl swore an oath of friendship, and of aid when summoned, to the Lords of Gondor, and thus the Rohirrim became the greatest ally of the Men of Gondor throughout the Third Age and beyond. They were known for their cavalry and horse mastery, which was crucial in battles such as the Battle of the Hornburg and on the Pelennor Fields.</p>
    <h1>Shire</h1>
    <p><a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Shire">The Shire</a> was the homeland of the majority of the hobbits in Middle-earth. It was located in the northwestern portion of Middle-earth, in the northern region of Eriador, within the remains of the Kingdom of Arnor.

	By the Third Age it was one of the few heavily-populated areas left in Eriador. Its name in Westron was Sûza, "Shire," or Sûzat, "The Shire." Contrary to popular misconception, the Shire was not the birthplace of Frodo Baggins, as he was born in Buckland, which at the time was not formally part of the Shire despite being colonized by Shire hobbits.

	At the end of the Third Age, Saruman (known then as Sharkey) tried to take control of it for a very short period, but was killed in the Battle of Bywater, which ended the War of the Ring.</p>
